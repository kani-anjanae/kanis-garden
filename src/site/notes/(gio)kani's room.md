This quote from James Baldwin. I believe he was speaking about the meaning behind his novel Giovanni's Room, hence the title of this page. Giovanni's Room has settled into my subconscious the some odd years ago that I read it and has slowly but surely altered the way I perceive love and the honesty it requires. Also how I approach and practice it. 

gio(kani)'s room is the name of my old substack page. It's the place I went to to teach myself how to practice love and to simply feel it. also to watch how it changes shape in my body as i learn and grow with the world around me. like it's namesake, gio(kani)'s room was supposed to force me into a certain intimacy with myself and the subject i'm considering. 

I don't post on that substack anymore lol I lost the password. but I still write with the gio(kani)'s room idea. Interrogationnnn. Like Mr. Baldwin said himself, writing is a form of interrogation. 

I'll link some of those interrogative pieces here. a likkle archive if you will. but it will grow, it will change
