# butterfly boy


Babies are born rounded and soft. For a while, they only know a gentle touch. Purity calls, soft and wanting and a mother will answer. It’s a shame when babies lose the cheeks and the rolls in their arms. They are still soft, but we can no longer see it. A baby, perhaps now a toddler, then a kid, pre-teen, teen, or adolescent. When a baby grows, we are no longer gentle.

Most cannot remember the day when every blow the world delivers becomes painful. Before long, they forget the resilience they had when they were rounded and soft. They forget that _whenever_ they called a parent answered. The babies evolved begin to assume they had always been hard. They forget their world was once the warmth of a womb. Nothing more, and certainly nothing less. They get used to the world’s blows and can no longer fathom a world that was ever gentle.

How can I tell you it was? How can I tell the teen, the adolescent, the adult that a kind and gentle touch was once reserved just for you? How can I tell you that even when we refuse to see it, we are all still rounded and soft?

The babies of today inherit a very difficult world. They will being to feel the blows during a state of great emergency. With a gentle touch, they will be accounted for in evacuation plans. Baby formula will be added to the rations. In the highest stage of capitalism, in this dystopia we call home, I wonder what you will grow up to be. What of us today will you know?

Will you see with your own eyes fires that ravage the land and gnash their teeth in rebellion of our ignorance?

Will you know trouble when you see it? Red Summers that make their centennial roundabout, _must_ you know why we call it red?

Will you feel the rough hands of our workers, see their rounded backs and tired feet? Will you too, have to break and bend your body for little more than what you need to keep it going?

Will you be able to see beyond the walls of our crumbling empire? Will you see soft and rounded babies whose faces reflect yours? Will you see them know violence and emergency in a different way than you do?

When you have grown, will you have traced the fires back to the source? Will you see that we are burning by fires we set and kerosene that has splashed on us as we doused the rest of the world?

When you have grown, will you remember what it was to be soft and rounded? Will you know what it’s like to breathe?

Today, Baby Butterfly, you are rounded and soft. The cutest smile I’ve ever seen. Tomorrow and the next day, I will remind you of your gentleness. It’s your softness now that we cannot afford to forget.
