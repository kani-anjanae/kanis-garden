# love, little sister


There’s a story that brews beneath the skin of every individual. When you can see it, they are beautiful. Why is it that I cannot see my own?

I want to be beautiful like my sisters are beautiful. I don’t know how to accurately describe what that is. Makayla is a mother. She carries a depth that you can always see but not quite touch. Experiencing Makayla is like standing on the edge of a cliff overlooking the sea. Deep and boldly blue, she quietly garners attention and calls you to contemplation.

Malaya is beautiful in the same way a flower is. She would be a flower and the rest of us bees. She blooms because she must and she is because she blooms. And in all that natural and unassuming beauty we all watch, we appreciate, and understand. She might not survive in a desert terrain or heavy tropical rains. But here it is perpetually spring. The sun shines on her face today and to all who experience her, she is beautiful always.

Why is it that I cannot see my own?

I have been an audience for as long as I have been conscious. I do not want to be, not always. But my face does not turn towards the sun like Malaya’s. The depth I contain is not seen from a distance like Makayla’s. I am hidden from everyone including myself.

Perhaps the beauty of me exists in my ability to imbue others with it. I believe in the poetry of all things. At times I feel fickle because the poetry is the only thing I believe in. I do not yet have a lived story I can tell. Only those that I have seen and have felt.

I know how to be art with words written or spoken. I know how to be art through movement, rhythms, and song. I know how to be art through an image of life, an attempt to preserve what the mind’s eye sees.

But art doesn’t feel like art to me in the way that I walk. I find a lack of poetry in the way I converse with those around me. Art doesn’t feel like art when it’s me in the world walking and talking and living and breathing even though to be art, I know these things are all it takes.

Why is it that I cannot see my own?

It is a scary thing to live life in a world that teaches how not to love. It is a lonely and debilitating thing to grow accustomed to this world, which is to say you learn without even realizing how not to love yourself.

Malaya sent me pictures of us together. In them, she is the sun and I am her flower. She is pretty in pink, purple, red, blue, black, white. She is beautiful when she texts me at 3 am because that is just what she does. She is beautiful because it is love that warms her body and gives color to her cheeks.

Makayla gifted me one of her books for Christmas. She has invited me to dangle my legs over the edge of the cliff. She has splashed my face just a bit with her crashing waves. She is beautiful because she creates life and she is beautiful because she shares it with me.

I’m the little sister. Malaya is the sun, Makayla the moon, and I the stars that dot the sky around them. I guess in this way, we are art together.
