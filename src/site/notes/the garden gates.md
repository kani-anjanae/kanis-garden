"id rather be stricken blind than to live without expression of the mind" - my glorious king Tupac Shakur

Hello world! lets goooo kani anjanae mind map, digital garden, lets goooo

My mind already works like a wikipedia page anyways and I have this horrible fear of running out of paper and ink for my thoughts and also losing them so here I am!

I love lists and doing things and making things and thinking things. I love to learn. I want a lot out of life! I want to appreciate it as much as possible, maybe even in retrospect as some things pass me by

Here's where my [[poetry\|poetry]] will live! My opinion pieces! My interrogation pieces that I really just write to help myself develop new ideas! Books I want to read! Books ive read ad have thoughts about. Music i want to enjoy! [[books\|books]], Movies and TV shows as well! Places I'd like to go! Movements and people groups Ive been learning!

Information I learn about people and art and history and culture and revolution and love and the world! 

Things i want to do with my life someday! plans for how to do it! plans to take care of myself! A journal to know myself! Notes! Like my commonplace book but digital almost!! More like a catalog of those things tho ngl. Memes! Pieces of art i resonate with! things of that nature. lets goooooo

though, not everything I have in here will be public. If you click on a link and it seems broken, mind ya business! It's probably a private page :)
